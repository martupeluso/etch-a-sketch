# Etch-a-Sketch

This project was created as part of the 'JavaScript Basics' section ofÂ [The Odin Project](https://www.theodinproject.com/)'s 'Foundations' course.

The Etch-a-Sketch is an interactive grid where users can "draw" by hovering over squares.

My personal touch: this one uses a beautiful pastel color palette! ðŸŽ¨
